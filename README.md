# **Image Tagger: Batch Metadata Editor**

**Image Tagger** is a streamlined Windows application designed for stock photographers, archivists, and AI dataset creators. It automates the tedious process of writing Titles and Keywords to thousands of JPEG images by matching them with a simple text file.

## **🚀 Two Versions Available**

We offer two versions of the application on the Microsoft Store to suit different workflows:

### **1\. Image Tagger Lite (Free)**

* **Best for:** Simple, linear tagging.  
* **Function:** Matches Line 1 of a text file to Image 1 in a folder.  
* **Speed:** Extremely fast, minimal interface.

### **2\. Image Tagger Pro (Paid)**

* **Best for:** Visual culling, cropping, and complex batching.  
* **Features:**  
  * **Visual Editor:** Built-in image viewer with Zoom and Pan.  
  * **Crop Tool:** Crop images to new compositions while preserving metadata.  
  * **Batching:** Apply one text prompt to a "batch" of X images (e.g., 1 prompt for every 4 variations).  
  * **Minimap:** Navigational map for high-res zooming.

## **✨ Features**

* **Bulk EXIF Writing:** Writes standard XPTitle (Windows Title), XPKeywords (Windows Tags), and ImageDescription (IPTC/Standard).  
* **Agency-Ready CSV Export:** Automatically generates a metadata.csv log file (with Filename, Title, Keywords, Category columns) formatted for direct upload to **leading stock photography marketplaces**.  
* **Universal Compatibility:** Metadata is readable by Windows Explorer, Lightroom, Bridge, and other asset managers.  
* **Smart Sorting:** Automatically sorts images alphanumerically (img\_001.jpg, img\_002.jpg) to ensure alignment with your text list.  
* **Privacy Focused:** Runs 100% offline. No data is sent to the cloud.
